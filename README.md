* In this repo , I have created 4 files -

*  Titanic dataset without using pipeline
*  Prediction without pipeline
*  Titanic dataset with pipeline
*  Prediction with pipeline
* All the files works accordingly

* Pipeline chains together the multiple steps so that the output of each step is used as the input of the next step.
  Pipelines makes it easy to apply the same preprocessing to train and test.
